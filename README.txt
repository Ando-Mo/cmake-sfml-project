Press Enter to get past the first screen. 

Press 1 to select 1P Mode, which will let you face off against the CPU controller. 
Press 2 to select 2P Mode, which will let you control both paddles. 

Paddles can be moved up and down. 
This is done with W and A for P1 (the left paddle), 
and Up and Down for P2 (the right paddle). 

Press P to pause the game, and P again to resume the game. 

Please excuse the hideous colors. I thought it would be funny.
